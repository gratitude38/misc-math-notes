Let the vector $\bold{A}$ be defined as:
$$
\bold{A} = A \bold{e}_r
$$
where $A$ is the magnitude of the vector, and $\bold{e}_r$ is the unit vector in the radial direction. The unit vector $\bold{e}_r$ originates from the origin of the global coordinate system, i.e., $(0, 0, 0)$. Any changes in the magnitude of $\bold{A}$ occur along the direction of $\bold{e}_r$, which defines the radial direction.

The time derivative of the vector $\bold{A}$ is given by:
$$
\dot{\bold{A}} = \dot{A} \bold{e}_r + A \dot{\bold{e}}_r
$$
This expression indicates that over time, the vector $\bold{A}$ may change in both its magnitude $A$ and/or its direction, represented by the unit vector $\bold{e}_r$. A change in direction is characterised by a variation in the orientation of $\bold{e}_r$. Since $\bold{e}_r$ is anchored at the origin and only its endpoint moves, this change in direction can be described by the angular variation $\theta$, which measures the difference between the previous and current orientations of $\bold{e}_r$.

We can express the unit vector $\bold{e}_r$ in terms of the angle $\theta$ as follows:
$$
\bold{e}_r = \cos \theta \ \bold{e}_x + \sin \theta \ \bold{e}_y
$$
where $\bold{e}_x$ and $\bold{e}_y$ are the unit vectors along the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively, in the Cartesian coordinate system.

It is important to note that changing the orientation angle $\theta$ does not affect the magnitude of the vector. This implies that the direction of angular change, represented by a new unit vector $\bold{e}_\theta$, must be perpendicular to $\bold{e}_r$. Mathematically, this orthogonality condition is expressed as $\bold{e}_r \cdot \bold{e}_\theta = 0$. This condition can be satisfied if:
$$
\bold{e}_\theta = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \bold{e}_r = -\sin \theta \ \bold{e}_x + \cos \theta \ \bold{e}_y
$$
Here, $\bold{e}_\theta$ represents the direction of angular motion and is perpendicular to $\bold{e}_r$, as required.

Now, we observe that the time derivative of $\bold{e}_r$ can be calculated as:
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \bold{e}_r = \frac{d \cos \theta}{d \theta} \frac{d \theta}{dt} \ \bold{e}_x + \frac{d \sin \theta}{d \theta} \frac{d \theta}{dt} \ \bold{e}_y
$$
Simplifying this expression, we get:
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \bold{e}_r = \frac{d \theta}{dt} \left( -\sin \theta \ \bold{e}_x + \cos \theta \ \bold{e}_y \right)
$$
This simplifies further to:
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \bold{e}_r = \frac{d \theta}{dt} \bold{e}_\theta
$$
Thus, the time derivative of the vector $\bold{A}$ can be rewritten as:
$$
\dot{\bold{A}} = \dot{A} \bold{e}_r + A \dot{\theta} \bold{e}_\theta
$$
Alternatively, the derivative of $\bold{A}$ with respect to time can be expressed as:
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \bold{A} = \frac{dA}{dt} \bold{e}_r + A \frac{d \theta}{dt} \bold{e}_\theta
$$
This final expression clearly shows that the rate of change of $\bold{A}$ has two components: the rate of change of the magnitude $A$ in the radial direction $\bold{e}_r$, and the rate of change of the angular position $\theta$ in the direction perpendicular to $\bold{e}_r$, represented by $\bold{e}_\theta$.
